# Practical 7
This folder contains scripts: prac07.c, dynamic_allocation.c

## Description:
1. prac07.c
This script calculates Taylor Series.

2. dynamic_allocation.c
This calculates the Inverse Hyperbolic Tangent function 

## Instructions:
Compile: Use a C compiler (e.g., GCC) to compile and execute the code.
The code is complied and executed using VSCode

Use the following commands:


gcc dynamic_allocation.c -o dynamic_allocation.c -lm
./dynamic_allocation.c

Understand the relation between arrays and pointers
A pointer is the address of a memory location of another variable of the same type
An array is the data structure in c used to store elements of the same type.  
In C, the name of an array is a pointer


gcc prac07.c -o prac07.c -lm
./prac07.c

find e using taylor series when x=1

PS:"-lm" is to map math library to the gcc
