# Practical 2
This folder contains scripts: Conversion.c and Sum.c

## Description:
1. Conversion.c
This script demonstrates the printing output using basic C programming.

2. Sum.c
This script demonstrates the use of scanf, ie. it is used to read input by user.

The result involves the contrast between two totals computed in distinct ways. 
One result is derived through an incremental loop, while the other arises from a decremental loop. 
The final output is the discrepancy between these two computed sums.

## Instructions:
Compile: Use a C compiler (e.g., GCC) to compile and execute the code.
The code is complied and executed using VSCode

Use the following commands:

- For Question 1 :
gcc Conversion.c -o Conversion.c -lm -Wall

- Print
./Conversion.c

- For Question 2:
gcc Sum.c -o Sum.c -Wall

- Print
./Sum.c

PS:"-lm" is to map math library to the gcc; "-Wall" is to show all the warnings
